STESSI (A Simple Tesseract Integration) - creates an interface for OCR 
and TTS to work together, through: browser-based GUI and CLI. Scripting
initiated ~20 July, 2020, and went through rewrites for simplicity. We're
open to have fun, report, ask, answer, and code.



Dependency packages for Unix-like systems:
- python3, ffmpeg, libleptonica-dev, liblept5, tesseract-ocr*

(*a large compiled tesseract-ocr binary is included in: ./tesseract/bin/)

Dependency modules for Python3 (using PIP):
- updog (GUI)
- gtts



Installing/Using:
GUI: 
-- `./stessi.py`
-- From a browser, access `localhost:8080`. Upload image files, and get 
   text & audio outputs.

CLI (not yet): 
-- `python3 stessi.py [directory containing images to input]`



Support the Little Plans Ahead:
1. Friendly & Cordial GUI: Multi-language directories 
like - ben, eng, etc. You upload in them.
 -- Remains hidden stessi.py by: ".stessi.py". Suddenly one directory
    appears named 'text'. As gTTS makes audio, appears suddenly the 
    'audio' directory.
 -- Somehow support multi-user in GUI. How's that possible? 
    EMERGENCY MEETING!!!!
2. Make CLI.
 -- args: fileNames, lang
 -- echo `file $fileName`; #if image fileTypes, proceed.
